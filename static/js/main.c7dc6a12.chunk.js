To accomplish this, RadGrad presents an alternative to GPA with Innovation, Competency, Experience points also known as MyI.C.E. In addition, RadGrad is designed to provide a \u201cknowledge base\u201d about the discipline including topic areas (called \u201cInterests\u201d) and Career Goals, Courses, Opportunities, (and in the near future), Internships. The goal for this summer is to make RadGrad v2.0 ready for deployment into both the ICS Department and the Computer Engineering program starting in Fall 2021. This summer, we participated in the development and evaluation of the second major version of RadGrad. So far, we improved the functionality of the system, and made progress on the integration of InternAloha, a plugin designed to help students find internships. In addition, we conducted a pilot study to investigate ways to improve the system based on real-life student perspectives. The results of the pilot study will be used to improve the design of the system, and include such findings as: user experience issues and the lack of incentive of some features.
