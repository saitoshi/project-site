registered ICS students can use as a undergraduate career planner.\n          For example, if a certain student is interested in cybersecurity, using RadGrad they are able to see the recommended courses and possible intern programs.\n          Furthermore, RadGrad also has a point system in which as students advance through their studies they level up.\n          <Image

different issues that need to be worked on.\n          In the first week, the intern group concentrated on the welcoming task which centered around on reviewing the rules and conducts,\n          the research progress, and some review or learning Javascript and TypeScript.<br/>\n          Additionally, for the first week issues, we were asked to write essays on the different topics. Below here are the link to the essays.\n          <ul>\n            <li><NavLink exact to = \"/radgradreview\">RadGrad Reivew </NavLink></li>\n            <li><NavLink exact to = \"/radgradfeedback\">Comments on the Current RadGrad</NavLink></li>\n            <li><NavLink exact to = \"/radgradstart\">Review and Writing Code</NavLink></li>\n          </ul>\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/RadGradTask3.gif?raw=true'} size='big' centered/>\n          <div className=\"comment\">A sample gif from one of the coding tasks.</div>\n          <b><u>Week 2 Tasks</u></b><br/>\n          For the second week, we were given a list of good first issues and good second issues to work on.\n          Each member of the team selected an issue to work on. For instance, one of the first good issue I worked on was adding\n          ErrorFields to all of the AutoForms. After working on the first issue, I started to modify all the call statement into callPromise() and modifying\n          the error statement into a try and catch format. <br/>\n          <b><u>Week 3 Tasks</u></b><br/>\n          With the first and second good issues accomplished, Professor Johnson and Professor Moore modified the project board on GitHub to be organized where\n          there are two columns: Intern Issues & Professor Issues. With me being an intern, here are the following things I have accomplished over the third week.\n          <ul>\n            <li>Adding an optional picture field where users can add image for courses, interests, and career. </li>\n            <li>Fixing the update button such that when a user clicks on it, it will scroll the user back up to the page where the editable forum is located.</li>\n            <li>Created a Show More/Less Student button for the student display in the Career, Interest, and Opportunitie page. </li>\n            <li>Modified the Terms and Condition Page where users can agree or disagree at the page rather than doing it at the checklist component.</li>\n          </ul>\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/radgradtask/week3.gif?raw=true'} size='big' centered/>\n          <div className='comment'>A sample gif of the updates I made in Week 3.</div>\n          <b><u>Week 4/5 Tasks</u></b><br/>\n          For Week 4 and 5 two things were concentrated for the project. One was the normal programming related tasks.\n          For example, currently only students are able to add opportunities and courses to their profiles. However, I made modifications to the profile collection where Advisors\n          and Faculties are able to add it to their profile.\n          <br/>\n          The other thing that the group of interns was making a promotional video for RadGrad2.\n          The video's main purpose is to display it for the National Science Foundation (NSF) which is a sponsor for the RadGrad Research.\n          The video making was broken up into the following tasks. However, due to the interns working from home a traditional filming where everyone gathers into\n          one place. Therefore, we had to improvise on the filming to be different.\n          <ul>\n            <li>Screenplay: Shin Saito</li>\n            <li>Video Editing: Trey Sumida</li>\n          </ul>\n          <b><u>Week 6/7 Tasks</u></b><br/>\n          After creating the video, the project went back on working the application itself revising the necessary portions such as consistency.\n          For instance, the interests cards are now updated so that it is alphabetically organized rather than a meaningless order.\n          Additionally the visibility tabs were organized as the tab and the checklist order did not match. Users with the role of faculty and advisors can now add\n          opportunities to their user profile and that if they are not part of an opportunity group a message will display rather than blank.\n          <Image src={\"https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/user_opportunity.png?raw=true\"} size='large' centered/>\n          <div className='comment'>A screenshot of the a comment displaying that a user has not opportunity with them.</div>\n          <br/>\n          <b><u>Week 8/9 Tasks</u></b><br/>\n          During week 8 and 9, a pilot study was held with undergraduate students from Computer Science students. Depending on the participants preference,\n          the pilot study was held on either Zoom or Discord. With the set of questions written by Professor Johnson, the student interns asked the participants\n          what they felt about the current RadGrad system and how it could be further improved.\n          <b><u>Week 10</u></b><br/>\n        The last week of RadGrad we participated in the UH Research Group Presentation. Here the group participated in a Zoom Meeting where we created a poster presenting the\n        results of the Pilot Study done during Week 8 and 9. Additionally, a research paper was written to show the res ult of the Pilot Study.\n        <br/>\n        <b><u>Take Back From RadGrad Internship</u></b><br/>\n        This internship gave me a preview on working as a Software Engineer.<br/>\n        I think this gave me the opportunity to see what my current JavaScript and TypeScript skills. Furthermore, this internship was more\n        freestyle than anything. We were given a list of task to select from to work on. By having the free choice, I can see what I am capable of and not.\n        <b>Link to the paper</b>\n        Thus, giving me an area to see where I need to improve on.\n        </Container>\n        <div className =\"push\"/>\n      </Container>\n\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default RadGrad2;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport '../style.css';\nimport { Header, Container, Grid, Image } from 'semantic-ui-react';\n\nfunction Shocking() {\n  return (\n      <Container>\n        <br/>\n        <Header as =\"h2\" textAlign=\"center\">Shocking Emissions</Header>\n        <Grid textAlign = \"center\">\n          <p textAlign=\"center\"> Software Engineering, Meteor, React</p>\n          <br/>\n        </Grid>\n        <Container text>\n          <hr/>\n          <p>\n          <b><u>OVERVIEW OF ICS 414</u></b>\n          <br/>\n          For ICS 414 Software Engineering II, the course teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.hei.com/\"> Hawaii Electric Industries </a> on creating an application that allows users to see their Green House Gases. The students were grouped into four teams of 6-7 people. The team I worked on was called “Shocking Development” and the application we created was called “Shocking Emissions”.\n          <ul>\n            <li>For the Github <a href =\"https://github.com/shocking-development/shockingdevelopment\">Repository</a></li>\n            <li> For the Project Group <a href = \"https://shocking-development.github.io/\">Page</a></li>\n          </ul>\n            <Image src={\"https://shocking-development.github.io/doc/landingPageM4.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n          <div className=\"comment\">The landing page of Shocking Emissions.</div>\n            <u><b> Contributions to Shocking Emissions</b></u>\n            <br/>\n            The different issues that were worked on for the projects were broken down into Milestones. Roughly every milestone was done in two weeks.\n            <br/>\n            <b> <a href =\"https://github.com/shocking-development/shockingdevelopment/projects/1\"> Milestone 1 </a></b> <br/>\n            For Milestone 1, I created the basic mock up on what each page should look like and then created an initial design on\n            the profile, log in, register (sign up) pages. <br/>\n            <b> <a href=\"https://github.com/shocking-development/shockingdevelopment/projects/2\"> Milestone 2</a></b>\n            <br/>\n            For Milestone 2, I participated in a group review and helped out with the profile database.\n            <br/>\n            <b><a href=\"https://github.com/shocking-development/shockingdevelopment/projects/3\"> Milestone 3</a></b>\n            <br/>\n            For Milestone 3, I particpated in another group review, made fix ups on the profile page where the profile card\n            shows the user's profile image, modified the edit profile page to have the image column, and finally modified\n            the admin capabilities.\n            <br/>\n            <b><a href=\"https://github.com/shocking-development/shockingdevelopment/projects/4\">Milestone 4</a></b><br/>\n            By Milestone 4, 90% of the application was set and running. At this stage each members were adding small modifications\n            to improve the application. My contribution was that I added an option so users can change units from US units to Metric System units.\n            <br/>\n            <b><a href=\"https://github.com/shocking-development/shockingdevelopment/projects/5\">Milestone 5</a></b>\n            <br/>\n            At Milestone 5, the group goal was to deploy the project to Digital Ocean and input some sample datas for multiple test users.\n            To create the fake data of users and the green house gas usages, the group created a random generator using\n            <a href= \"https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker\">Faker.js</a> where 20+ fake users and for each user 3 months of fake but beliveable data was created.\n            <br/>\n            <b><a href=\"https://github.com/shocking-development/shockingdevelopment/projects/6\">Milestone 6</a></b>\n            <br/>\n            For the last milestone, the main goal was to clean up the codes or functions on the application. For instance, I checked to see whether the files had appropriate comments or not. Additionally, per request of the customer a contact to Admin page was created.\n            <br/>\n            <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/shockingemissions.gif\"} size='large' centered />\n            <div className=\"comment\">The sample gif of the application itself.</div>\n            <u><b>Challeges to the Project</b></u>\n            <ul>\n              <li> <b> Time Management </b> <br/></li>\n              Unlike ICS 314, this course worked on a single project for one semester long. While one semester might look like a long time, because of taking other courses it flew by fast. Furthermore, since there was a semester to work on the application, there was no excuse to perfect it.\n              Therefore, time management was an important thing. One way was that our group took the milestone to our advantage by making milestone goals. For instance, milestone 1 had a goal to perfect the design or milestone 5 had a goal to perfect the fake data and its display.\n              <li> <b> Communication</b></li>\n              Since most of the communication was done through Discord using words, I had to be clear and concise on what I wanted to say. Especially, with a group so big that becomes important as a single small miscommunication may mess up any progress.\n              <li> <b> Awkward Silences</b></li>\n              With work being online, there are moments of “Awkward Silences”. However, I believe that they are a waste of time. To avoid silence during group meetings, I tried to ask questions or start a conversation to see which areas need to be worked on.\n            </ul>\n            <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/discord.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n            <div className=\"comment\">A screenshot of the group Discord chat server.</div>\n            <br/>\n            <u><b>Take Back From ICS 414</b></u>\n            <br/>\n            Despite going to school for a certain period, I have never worked in a large group. With the pandemic making this semester online, I have expected some issues to happen. However, the major issues that I have expected never happened. What my group did was set two meetings per week at a time where all of us could meet. Additionally, we created a Discord server for the team to do either word or voice chats.\n            <br/>\n            Furthermore, with the class being held online I personally think that it helped me to prepare for after graduation. I do expect the pandemic to continue, therefore, forcing things to remain online.\n            <br/>\n            Another factor that made the course helpful is because we had a customer. While the future is uncertain, I do expect that I will have to build applications based on customer preferences. Previously, I worked on projects based on requirements on a syllabus or instructor’s guidelines. However, by having a customer, frequent communications needed to be made to truly understand their expectations of the product.\n      <div class=\"push\">\n      </div>\n\n</p>\n        </Container>\n        <div className=\"push\"/>\n        </Container>\n\n\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Shocking;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport '../style.css';\nimport { Header, Container, Grid, Image } from 'semantic-ui-react';\n\nfunction TextbookHunt() {\n  return (\n      <Container>\n        <br/>\n        <Header as =\"h2\" textAlign=\"center\">Textbook Hunt</Header>\n        <Grid textAlign = \"center\">\n          <p textAlign=\"center\"> Software Engineering, Meteor, React</p>\n          <br/>\n        </Grid>\n        <Container text>\n          <hr/>\n          <p>\n            <b><u>OVERVIEW OF ICS 314</u></b>\n            <br/>\n            ICS 314 is the first semester and introduction course of Software Engineering.

Especially, with COIVD-19 lock down going, communication was essential. For this project, our team created issues or tasks to do where every week we sign up the one we are able or willing to do.\n            <br/>\n            <b> Week 1 Tasks </b> <br/>\n            For the first week, I have set up the page where students can sign up their books to sell and a page where it lists the possible textbooks that students can see that are on sale. To take a good look on what I was assigned, feel free to visit Milestone 1.\n            <br/>\n            <b> Week 2 Tasks </b> <br/>\n            For the second week, I have set up the advanced settings of what I did in the first week. For example, making the display cleaner and organized and have the navigation bar move as the user scrolls down the page.\n            <br/>\n            <b> Week 3 Tasks </b> <br/>\n            For the third week, I have cleaned up the final things such as moving the comments section and creating an Admin access where the admin can delete and edit books that might not seem appropriate.\n            <br/>\n            Overall by participating in this project, I have learned better scheduling. Since this project was assigned during the COVID-19 lock down, I had to create an efficient schedule and remind myself that time will only run out and continue working. Additionally, I have found a way to communicate to my team members without making them mad or furious.\n            <div class=\"push\">\n            </div>\n\n          </p>\n        </Container>\n        <div className=\"push\"/>\n      </Container>\n\n\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default TextbookHunt;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Header, Container, Grid, Image } from 'semantic-ui-react';\n\nfunction CrossCountry() {\n  return (\n      <Container>\n        <br/>\n        <Header as =\"h2\" textAlign=\"center\">Algo-Trix</Header>\n        <Grid textAlign = \"center\">\n          <p textAlign=\"center\"> Software Engineering, Software Quality Assurance, React <br/></p>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid textAlign =\"center\">\n          <p textAlign =\"center\">  <span className=\"bold-list\"> On Going</span></p>\n        </Grid>\n        <Container text>\n          <hr/>\n          <Header as =\"h3\" textAlign=\"left\">OVERVIEW OF ICS 427</Header>\n          During the 6 week period of ICS 427, the class was broken into teams of 3-4 people of their choice and were\n          asked to work on a single application project that highlighted the elements of Software Quality Assurance.\n          <br/>\n          The group I was part of was called <a href=\"https://cross-country-coders.github.io/\">Cross Country Coders</a>.\n          The application that the group created was called Algo-Trix which is a user-based application that people can study algorithms.\n          <br/>\n          <ul>\n            <li> The link to the <a href=\"https://cross-country-coders.github.io/\">GitHub Organization Page</a></li>\n            <li> The link to the <a href=\"https://github.com/cross-country-coders/algo-trix\">GitHub Repository Page</a></li>\n          </ul>\n          <Image src =\"https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/algotrix.png?raw=true\" centered/>\n          <div className=\"comment\">The logo created for AlgoTrix application.</div>\n          <b><u>Contributions to AlgoTrix</u></b><br/>\n          With ICS 427 being a six week course, our group took advantage of GitHub's <i>Kanban</i> by making Weekly Milestone Issues where each\n          week a member selected an issue to work on.\n          <ol>\n            <li><a href={\"https://github.com/cross-country-coders/algo-trix/projects/1\"}>Milestone 1</a></li>\n            For Milestone 1, the main goal was to get the mock designs for the application to be created.\n            To begin with the group used <a href={\"https://www.figma.com/files/recent?fuid=934216239644834346\"}>Figma</a> to make mock up designs.

平成特撮は「特撮像」を全体的に昭和と⽐べると変わりました。特撮は基本的には半年から\n          1 年間の週⼀回の連続放送。昭和シリーズは基本的には 1、2 話で完結や、バラエティー感覚で\n          物語が企画された。しかし、現在の作品は NHK などで放送されている⼤河ドラマのような連続\n          ドラマ性を強調し、特撮が企画される。オダギリジョーによると当時の番組プロデューサーは\n          クウガを企画される際、「特撮」より「⼀般的なドラマ」なイメージが強かった。例えば、仮\n          ⾯ライダークウガでは⼩さな事件が前後編で 2 話にわたり解決し、1 年間にわたって 1 話に現\n          れた怪⼈の⾏⽅の謎を解いたり、視聴者に番組を⾒る理由を与える。昭和仮⾯ライダーシリー\n          ズは最終回近辺以外は基本的に 1 話完結で放送されていた。<br/>\n\n          「地球戦隊ファイブマン」をプロデューサーとして担当していた、鈴⽊武幸⽒は売り上げ不調\n          とマンネリ化から⽴ち直るために、様々な⼿段を選んだ。例えば、今までに、シリーズにはな\n          い物語を作るために新⼈の監督と脚本家が起⽤された。井上敏樹先⽣は「⿃⼈戦隊ジェットマ\n          ン」ではシリーズ 10 作⽬「超新星フラッシュマン」より参加していたために、戦隊の簡単な知\n          識を持ちながら。彼が今まで不⾃然と感じていた物語でなく、⾃然的におかしくはない要素を\n          取り⼊れた。⼀つは当時話題の「トレンディドラマ」要素を取り⼊れ、戦隊の男⼥交際を強調\n          する。ジェットマンのシリーズ構成を担当した井上先⽣は戦隊に今まで恋愛要素に無いのがお\n          かしいと⾔う気持ちで脚本を書いた「1」。ジェットマンでは、チーム内の恋愛三⾓関係が原因で\n          戦隊の解散危機などが取り上げられた。これにより⼦供だけではなく、保護者などの⼤⼈が⼊\n          り、視聴率が昨年のファイブマンからの 6%から 7.1％へと上がった[2]\n          。<br/>\n          ⼤抵の⼈は「特撮」と⾔う⾔葉を⽿にすると幼児⽤番組を浮かび上がるだろう。しかし,\n          AMAZON PRIME や YOUTUBE RED などの動画配信サービスが発達している現在、制作会社は様々\n          な。動画配信サービスは幼児向け番組としてのイメージを裏切りように難しい番組などが制作\n          される。2017 年は、AMAZON PRIME ⽤ドラマシリーズ、「仮⾯ライダーアマゾンズ」が配信さ\n          れる。メインテーマを「⾎」や「狩り」を取り⼊れ、仮⾯ライダーシリーズの通常要素を取り\n          ⼊れながらも、シリーズの通常時間枠で放送出来ない要素を取り⼊れた。通常の仮⾯ライダー\n          とは違う「ハード―バイオレンス」が。第⼀シーズンの好評のために、アマゾンズはシーズン\n          2 や劇場版が両⽅制作された。<br/>\n          <b> B. ヒーロー像の変化 </b> <br/>\n          他にも⼤きく変わったのは「ヒーロー像」、主役の特徴に変化だ。昭和の仮⾯ライダー基本\n          的に熱く書かれていて、当時の⼦供達の理想的な「カッコよさ」で描かれていた。しかし、平\n          成からは⼦供達が思う「カッコよさ」を取り⼊れながら、暴⼒的な強さと精神的なたくましさ\n          ではなく、争いの⾟さや哀しさを知り、⼈の⼼を癒せる「ヒーロー像」で企画された。例え\n          ば、「仮⾯ライダークウガ」の主⼈公、五代雄介（演：オダギリジョー）は優しい⼈柄で物語\n          が進んだ。このような優しいキャラクターが 9.7%[3]の視聴率で視聴者に受けたために、その後\n          のシリーズにも昭和にありがちな「逞しさ」ではなく、視聴者に近いイメージで「ヒーロー像\n          が毎年企画される。次回作の仮⾯ライダーアギド（演：賀集利樹）は同じように「リアリテ\n          ィ」を起⽤しクウガを上回る、11.7%[4]を残した。\n          このような、親近感があるヒーローを出すために、東映側では「⼀般市⺠ヒーロー」を取り\n          上げるようになる。例えば、昭和戦隊シリーズのメンバーは基本的に戦いの専⾨や組織に。し\n          かし平成よりに活躍した英雄は⾼校性、お巡りさん、サラリーマン、ニートなどの視聴者に近\n          い存在が起⽤される。元東映のプロデューサーで現在は⾓川で努めている⾼寺しげのりはイン\n          タビューでヒーローを書く際「超⼈的な理想像」、ではなく現実社会における理想に⼈間像と\n          してヒーロー像を始めた[5]。例えば、⾼寺プロデューサーが初メインとして、担当した「激⾛\n          戦隊カーレンジャー」は特撮歴史で初サラリーマンヒーロー。このような親近感ヒーロー像は\n          今後の作品にも影響した。\n          社会的親近感以外にも、平成より「対⽴するヒーロー」が導⼊される。例えば、昭和ではヒ\n          ーローの間の喧嘩もありながら、対⽴などは⾒られない。視聴者に正義と⾔う⾔葉がどのよう\n          に難しい事かを教えるために、各作品では簡単な喧嘩ではなく、⻑編ドラマ構成にわたって対\n          ⽴した。例えば、平成ウルトラ作品の三代⽬の「ウルトラマンガイア」ではウルトラマンが⼆\n          ⼈登場する。⼈類の味⽅の⾚いウルトラマン、「ガイア」と⽣命を消す事が真の平和だと信じ\n          る、⻘いウルトラマン「アグル」。このように⼦供などの視聴者に正義がどのくらい難しい内\n          容かが⾒られる。<br/>\n          東映作品に対⽴の考えが導⼊されたのはプロデューサーの⽩倉伸⼀郎⽒からだろう。昭和特\n          撮作品のヒーローの対⽴などの姿が少ない理由は、昭和のヒーローへの考え⽅は絶対正義。し\n          かし、⽩倉⽒の担当される作品は基本的に昭和特撮作品にあった善悪⼆元論に懐疑的であった\n          ため、彼が担当される作品は、ヒーローであっても⼈間性を全体に出す、あるいは「正義でも\n          悪でもない、⼈間が⽣きるために必要な事」を物語に出す[5]。例えば、⽩倉⽒がメインプロデ\n          ーサーとして担当した「仮⾯ライダー⿓騎」は 13 ⼈の仮⾯ライダーが⾃らの⼈間的な欲望の為\n          にお互い殺し合う所が作品の⾒せ場。作品のキャッチコピーは「戦わなければ⽣き残れな\n          い」。このような難しいテーマ−が選択された理由は 2001 年 9 ⽉ 11 ⽇のアメリカ同時多発テ\n          ロが起きたために⽩倉⽒は⼦供達に正義の難しさを教えるために、脚本家と監督と相談し、13\n          ⼈の仮⾯ライダーが違う正義の考えを代表し、戦いのドラマが展開した[5]。<br/>\n          <b> A. 俳優陣 </b> <br/>\n          他にも昭和と平成を分けるポイントは、俳優陣。昭和作品は基本的にスタントマンが して\n          いる会社、JAC でヒーローの俳優が決まる。しかし、平成に⼊ると特撮だけではなく、基本的\n          にテレビで放送されているドラマが減少する。そのために、新⼈の役者は特撮をデビュー作と\n          して扱い、芸能界に⼊る事になる。仮⾯ライダー、戦隊シリーズ、やウルトラマンは現在「俳\n          優⼊⾨」として呼ばれている。仮⾯ライダーや戦隊シリーズは 1 年間放送のために役者にとっ\n          て様々な事が習える。現在、若い⼥性の間に⼈気の俳優「⽵内涼真」は「仮⾯ライダードライ\n          ブ」で芸能界にデビューをした[6]。他にも演技だけではなく、ヒーロー役が後に声優として活\n          躍されるのも例外ではない。声優の M.A.O.は「海賊戦隊ゴーカイジャー」でイエローとして⼥\n          優デビューしたが、その後声優として活動開始した。<br/>\n          しかし、新⼈のみではスポンサーや視聴率などが得るの困難になる。準レギュラーやゲスト\n          にベテラン俳優を起⽤する事により、スポンサーや視聴率だけではなく、ベテラン俳優が新⼈\n          に芸能界についてに教わる事が可能。\n          新⼈役者以外にも平成作品では、アイドルやジャニーズグループのメンバーの活躍もみられ\n          るようになる。例えば、ウルトラマンティガのダイゴを演じたのはジャニーズグループ、V6 の\n          ⼀⼈、。このようなアイドルメンバーを起⽤することにより、アイドルファンなどが番組を\n          ⾒、視聴率への上がりにつながる。他にもアイドルグループの起⽤により、主題歌、もしくは\n          挿⼊歌を歌ってもらうため、売り上げにもつながる。ウルトラマンティガの主題歌、「TAKE\n          ME HIGHER」は V6 が担当し、ウルトラマンシリーズ初オリコンチャートに登場した。他にも、\n          2017 年より放送開始した、「ガールズ x 戦⼠シリーズ」で主役を演じる⼦供はタレントグルー\n          プとして活躍するため、CD シングルは初週 1.5 枚を売り、そして玩具の売り上げが 2017 年と\n          ⽐べると 350%上がった[7]。\n          本稿ではまず、特撮の昭和作品と平成作品の変化について調べた。物語の企画⽅や登場⼈物\n          のヒーロー像の違い、と起⽤される俳優陣のイメージ変化。結果として、特撮は昭和から平成\n          作品は⼤きいな変化を⾒た。しかしながら、プロデューサーや監督がどのような気持ちで制作\n          に⼊れたか得られなかった。例えば、個⼈的の過去がどのような強い影響があったのか、もし\n          くはスポンサーやテレビ局側からどのようなプレッシャーなどをさらに調査をしたい。⼜は番\n          組⾃体の企画書と放送された物語が変わったかも気になる。次回は今持っている情報を元に更\n          に特撮番組の企画と制作についてにも注⽬をし、今後の課題としたい。\n\n          <hr/>\n            [1] 「戦隊 20 年の戦い シリーズの変遷 ヒーロー性の多様化 ⿃⼈戦隊ジェットマン」<br/>\n            [2]

Star allows you to register for courses, pay for your tuition, scholarship, and see your current academic standings. However, as a STEM, especially as an ICS student there are moments where you feel Star is not enough. Star does not provide internship details or in-depth recommended career paths. To support the many flaws, an ICS student has RadGrad. This application provides ICS students ways on how they can attain their career goals, a list of courses they should take, and many more. Additionally, it has a level and point system like Pokemon providing an incentive to do better. Despite the many strength, because of the “Ying and Yang” rule, there are some weaknesses that RadGrad struggles in.\n            <Image src={\"https://www.radgrad.org/assets/images/ice-example-b89aedaa1bd783119aca969f47745f02.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n            <div className=\"comment\"> A screenshot of a page from RadGrad</div>\n            <h4> Strength </h4>\n            <ol>\n              <li> <span class = \"bold-list\">Priority List System</span></li>\n              The things that are necessary and not are organized neatly. Furthermore, within each card that needs action a simple explanation on how to fix is provided making it easier for user to fix or update.\n              <li><span class =\"bold-list\"> Course Page</span> </li>\n              The course page is automatically set up; therefore, users do not have to manually add courses one by one. However, students still have the ability to manually add courses based on their interests. Which is helpful to student to schedule out their future semesters more effectively than Star.\n            </ol>\n            <h4> Weakness </h4>\n            Here are some of the following the current RadGrad system tends to be weak at.\n            <ol>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\">Consistency</span></li>\n              The current application lacks in the area of design consistency. For instance, within the  opportunities page the usage of bold font is inconsistent. For example, Amazon Web Service has its name bolded whereas Android or IOS does not. From a personal opinion, if one is bolded maybe, it is better to do so for the others.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/title.png\"} size='medium' centered/>\n\n              <div className=\"comment\">Inconsistent formatting in titles.</div>\n              <br/>\n              Another example is that some buttons have auto-translations on despite everything else is in English. For instance, on the student review pages, the submit button for me is written in Japanese kanji rather than English. While making assumptions goes against my mathematical background, I assume that most of the RadGrad users will understand what submit is. Therefore, consistency should be applied to the language area too.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/submit.png\"} size='medium' centered/>\n              <div className=\"comment\">Everything else but submit is in English.</div>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\">Filter or Search Function</span></li>\n              As of right now, RadGrad has a good search function, but I still think it is not as user-friendly as it could be. For example, in the Interest Page, maybe the varieties listed could be filter based on the category of its interest. For instance, Java, C, or Python could be programming languages whereas others could be different. Additionally, something similar to this could be added to the Career Page also. Having a stronger search function makes users to condense their time spent on the app and they may explore other features available.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/filter.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n              <div className=\"comment\">Add more ways to filter through the different choices.</div>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\">Student Planner</span></li>\n              Currently, it is said that Student Planner should be a reflection on the registered information on Star. However, as of right now it contains ICS courses that I have no recollection of registering both on Star or RadGrad, The other case would be that I have registered to take a certain course next semester, but it is claiming that I a repeating a certain course. For instance, I am registered for ICS 313 in Fall 2021, but on RadGrad’s student planner it is listed that I took it in the Spring 2021 and will take it again in the Fall.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/duplicate.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n              <div className=\"comment\">A duplicate ICS 313 and additional courses that I have not taken.</div>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\">Deletion Whiteout</span></li>\n              When I deleted the internship from Student Planner, while it successfully deletes it from the page it whitens out the page. Even though page comes back after reloading it, I think this is an area that should be fixed for convinient usages.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/duplicate.png\"} size='medium' centered/>\n            </ol>\n            <h4> Areas For Growth Opportunity </h4>\n            Despite the strength and weakness listed above, there are many areas in which can be improved upon.\n            <ol>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\"> Adding a Column For Class Environment</span></li>\n              With the upcoming Fall 2021 semester, the school is gradually transitioning back to an in-person environment. However, that implies that there is going to be a mixture, of course, such as in-person, hybrid, and online. In addition, online even has its subcategory of synchronous and asynchronous courses. For instance, my ICS 321 course in Spring 2021 was online asynchronous but in Fall 2021, ICS 485 is scheduled to be in person or at least staggered.\n              Furthermore, from personal experience, I was advised by Gerald Lau to take ICS 212 at Leeward Community College. Therefore, maybe when students are adding reviews another dropdown could be added to indicate the campus or if they took it at Manoa or not. That way prospective students can have a better idea on whether which campus they should take courses at.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/dropdown.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n              <div className=\"comment\">Probably could add a dropdown of campus option between term and satisfaction.\n              </div>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\">Separate Teaching and Tutoring</span></li>\n              On the course planner page, Teaching and Tutoring are categorized as one of the same things. While this may sound more personal, I have a feeling that they are two different things. From a personal opinion, I see teaching covering one subject versus tutoring cover multiple subjects. Especially, with the Learning Assistant Program expanding, maybe it might be effective to separate the two into two bars. Furthermore, we might be able to add the growing Learning Assistant Program.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/tutor.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n              <div className=\"comment\">A sample block of the Teaching or Tutoring block.</div>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\">Verification Process</span></li>\n              It is better to believe in the goodness of people there are people who are rotten and will cheat out of a system. Maybe when students are typing for the verification process for an internship, there could be a box that asks for the supervisor’s email or contact information. That way the RadGrad staff can verify just to be safe.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/verification.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\">Missing ICS courses</span></li>\n              On the student planner and the courses list, there are few ICS courses that are missing that I have either taken or registered for. For instance, I am planning to take ICS 427 this Summer and ICS 496 Capstone Project on the Fall 2021. However, the selection of these two courses are nowhere to be found.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/427.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n              <div className=\"comment\">The missing ICS 427 I am going to take for Summer 2021.</div>\n            </ol>\n            <br/>\n            <h3>Benefits of Reviews</h3>\n            Living in the era of \"positive wokeness\", people tend to not point out flaws in both people and objects. However, in a professional manner, I think it is neccessary to point out flaws. Having flaws means that there is opportunity for growth.\n            For example, finding the area of errors that the current deployed RadGrad right now can grow the user happiness. Why? It is beause these errors are fixed before the general usage. When users are happy using the system, it means that the application is doing a good job. Therefore, pointing out the area of errors and improvement is a neccesary thing. Without it nothing can change.\n            </p>\n        </Container>\n        <div className=\"push\"/>\n      </Container>\n\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default RadGradReview;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Header, Container, Grid, Image } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport '../style.css';\n\nfunction RadGradFeedback() {\n  return (\n      <Container>\n        <br/>\n        <Header as =\"h2\" textAlign=\"center\">RadGrad Grad Feedback</Header>\n        <Grid textAlign = \"center\">\n          <p>RadGrad, Summer Intern, Software Engineering</p>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid textAlign = \"center\">\n          <p><span className=\"bold-list\">May 20, 2021</span></p>\n        </Grid>\n        <Container text>\n          <hr/>\n          <p>\n            Life is a truly unfair and cruel place. They say if you have a dream you should be able to pursue it. However, if you do not have the right credentials, you are more likely not allowed to do otherwise. This affects many freshmen in college as they enter a STEM field. Most of them have big dreams, but because of their poor resources, many end up in despair. If only if there was a tool that provided students with assistance in Computer Science at least. Well, there is. It is called RadGrad.\n            <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/RadGradHome.png\"} size='large' centered />\n            <div className=\"comment\"> A screenshot of when user logs into RadGrad.</div>\n            <h4>Purpose of RadGrad</h4>\n            RadGrad is an application that provides Computer Science students an incentive to do better. To help those\n            regardless of their backgrounds such as racial, sexual, academic, etc. The application contains a degree\n            planner and a list of possible interests. For example, Computer Science alone is a vague major as it is\n            comprised of various disciplinary fields such as Data Science, Cyber Security, Software Engineering, etc.\n            Therefore, it assists students in at least two ways.\n\n            This Summer 2021 (May - August period) 5 undergraduate students under Professor Johnson and Professor Moore\n            are working on to make updates on RadGrad. The reason behind these updates are to make improvements that\n            allow more student usage. For example, open RadGrad to other STEM majors or giving access to high school\n            students.\n\n\n            <h4> Benefits On Doing RadGrad</h4>\n            Most UH students know what Star is, and because of that many might not see the benefits of RadGrad.\n            While Star may allow students to register for their courses, there are multiple ways in which RadGrad is\n            still superior.\n\n            <ul>\n              <li> <span class = \"bold-list\">Freshmen or Undecided</span></li>\n              For those who are undecided on what they would like to do specifically, RadGrad provides low-cost and investments such as clubs, events, or free workshops on different fields. Furthermore, within the different lists of interests, faculty members or staff are listed making it easier on who to talk to.\n\n              <li> <span class = \"bold-list\">Upperclassmen or Decided</span></li>\n              For those who have been decided, RadGrad also provides assistance too. For instance, it lists the different 300-400 level electives that may be helpful. For example, if a student is interested in Data Science, RadGrad can recommend ICS 435. Also, the application provides a list of internship or research opportunities that students can apply for making it a little easier.\n            </ul>\n            Rather than purely awarding students based on their GPA, RadGrad rewards based on Innovation, Competency, and Experience (ICE for short). That way students have a better incentive to do more while they are in college. With the ICE system, students can gain points and level up like a certain Nintendo game that came out in 1996.\n            <h4> Improvements For RadGrad</h4>\n            While RadGrad is superior, it still has an area for improvement. One of the major reasons is because computer science is continuously changing. In order for RadGrad to be superior to Star, it constantly needs to reflect on the changes. For instance, the ICS department now offers more courses about Data Science that have not been reflected on. While on a personal level, RadGrad also misses a component in which could recommend in what to double major or get a minor that could complement their major.\n\n            <h4> Getting Community Input </h4>\n            One way to make improvement is to get feedback. However, because of the current global situation getting feedback needs to be done in creative ways. One thing that could be done is Zoom interviews with current undergrads, high school students, graduate students, and professionals.\n            <ul>\n              <li> <span class = \"bold-list\">Undergraduates</span></li>\n              By asking current undergraduates, it allows us to see which area needs improvement. Additionally, we can ask about the things they like or dislike with the application and list it down when future updates are made.\n              <li> <span class = \"bold-list\">Graduates</span></li>\n              By talking to graduate students, the developer team can see how other Universities are doing with degree planners and probably borrow an element that may be beneficial to add.\n              <li> <span class = \"bold-list\">High School students</span></li>\n              Interviewing high school students, mainly Juniors and Seniors, getting their inputs could be beneficial as we can see what disciplinary fields are popular. Additionally, this could be one way to do an advertisement to show local students that you can get your degree locally.\n              <li> <span class = \"bold-list\">Professionals</span></li>\n              Finally, asking professionals can improve the degree planner that way students can effectively land a job they desire.\n            </ul>\n            Another way we could do this is provide a Google Forum for those who are either busy or uncomfortable to do a Zoom interview. Overall, I think a prize or reward should be provided for those who participate in these surveys to provide incentive.\n          </p>\n        </Container>\n        <div className=\"push\"/>\n      </Container>\n\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default RadGradFeedback;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { Header, Container, Grid, Image } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport '../style.css';\nimport { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction RadGradStart() {\n  return (\n      <Container>\n        <br/>\n        <Header as =\"h2\" textAlign=\"center\"> RadGrad Initial Join Up </Header>\n        <Grid textAlign = \"center\">\n          <p> RadGrad2, Summer 2021 Internship Program, Software Engineering</p>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid textAlign=\"center\">\n          <p><span className=\"bold-list\">May 21, 2021</span></p>\n        </Grid>\n        <Container text>\n          <br/>\n          <b><u>Overview Of Issue 468 Task 6</u></b>\n          <br/>\n          As an introduction task to the first week of the RadGrad 2.0 Summer 2021 Internship, there was a list of tasks for newcomers to do. Issue 468 centered around programming tasks for us to get used to the RadGrad environment.\n          <br/>\n          <b><u>Task 1 – Hello World</u></b>\n          <br/>\n          Regardless of the country in which you learned programming; the first task is always called “Hello-World”. This was no different for the RadGrad summer 2021 interns too. Using the sandbox portion provided by Professor Johnson and Professor Moore, we began by writing “Hello-World”.\n          However, this process also allowed us to see <span className=\"bold-list\">components</span> unique to RadGrad such as “RadGradHeader” and the “RadGradSegment”.\n          Additionally, this was the first time for me to use <a href={\"https://fomantic-ui.com/\"}>Fomantic UI</a> programming assignment.\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/radgrad-task1.png?raw=true'} size='huge' centered/>\n          <div className=\"comment\">A screenshot of the sandbox after Task 1.</div>\n          <b><u>Task 2 - User Display</u></b>\n          <br/>\n          After doing Hello World, the next task is to display the user names of the sandbox owner and the current user. To do begin, I created a component that stored the header and paragraphs in a separate component file.\n          Then using withTracker, I created two const called \"urlUser\", which stores the owner of the page and \"loggedInUser\" to store the current user by the help from meteor.\n          The challenging part for this task was grabbing the user display, but after taking a 15 minute break the solution I ended up was the following.\n          <br/>\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/task2code.png?raw=true'} size='big' centered/>\n          <br/>\n         <div className={'comment'}>The code I wrote to display the correct users.</div>\n          To test whether the code worked I logged in as an Admin to see whether it displayed the right users. After logging in it did as it displayed radgrad@hawaii.edu as the current user and my email as the owner of the sandbox.\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/radgrad-task2.png?raw=true'} size='huge' centered/>\n          <div className={'comment'}>A screenshot when I log in as radgrad@hawaii.edu.</div>\n          <b><u>Task 3 - Career Goal Display</u></b>\n          <br/>\n          For task 3, we had to create a career goal segment in which every time it refreshes, it displayed a new career option and its description.\n          Additionally, on the bottom it should display the total number of career choices available. <br/>\n          For this task, similar to Task 2, I created a component in which stored the basic parts required in Task 3 and in the SandBox page recreated the interface to store the consts from Task 2 and Task 3 into one area.\n          However, the difficult part was getting the consts as I had a hard time displaying the randomization of careers.\n          Initially, it would only display \"Data Science\" for me because the Career Interests when I played with RadGrad in ICS 211 was Data Science.\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/task3.png?raw=true'} size='big' centered/>\n          <br/>\n          After talking to some teammates, I was able to modify the code so the job selections are randomized. I modified the consts on the Task3Component Typescript and then use the Random function.\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/RadGradTask3.gif?raw=true'} size='big' centered/>\n          <div className={'comment'}>Now it displays other careers also.</div>\n          <b><u>Task 4 - RadGrad Labels</u></b><br/>\n          In Task 4, we were requested to work with the different labels available on RadGrad: CareerGoalLabel, InterestLabel, CourseLabel, OpportunityLabel, and UserLabel. To work on this task, I worked parts by parts to get a full understanding at first. To begin with, I started by creating and RadGradHeader of each part necessary: Career, Interest, Course, etc. After seeing that the skeleton of Task 4 working, I worked with the Mongo-related tasks. Initially, I started off by reading the article on the different labels given to us on the issue page. After that, I started off with the CareerGoalLabel.\n\n          I began by importing the label for Career and then used the \"map\" function to display the label as I learned both from ICS 314 and ICS 414. After getting used to with CareerLabel, I then went down the list of InterestLabel, CourseLabel, and so on.\n          Finally, working on the student or UserLabel was challenging because it was different from the previous. After using fetch as <span className=\"bold-list\"><code>isAlumni false }, {}).fetch()</code></span> then I loaded the student labels.\n          <Image src={'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saitoshi/images/main/task4.png'} size='medium' centered/>\n          <b><u>Task 5 - Interests Form</u></b><br/>\n          In task 5, the assignment was to create a forum which displays all the possible interests and after the selection is made then the corresponding description is displayed. To start on this, I rewatched the screencast from Professor Johnson and looked at the project I made in\n          ICS 314 and ICS 414. After setting up the basic components: RadGrad Header and RadGrad Segment, I went with working on the the interest schema basing it off of from <NavLink exact to = \"/shocking\">ICS 414 Shocking Development Project</NavLink>.\n          The first thing I did was grabbed the list of interests by using the follwoing line of code: <code>const availableInterests = interests.map(docToName);</code>.\n          <Image src={'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saitoshi/images/main/radgradtask/task5/task5code.png'} size='big' centered/>\n          <div className='comment'>The <span className=\"bold-list\">code</span> written to display the interests in the forum.</div>\n          <br/>\n          After writing out the schema, I used <span className=\"bold-list\">AutoForum, SelectField, and SubmitField</span> to make the forum to select the different interests.\n          After that, similar to Task 3 Segment, I used <span className=\"bold-list\">Markdown</span> to display the description cleanly.\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/radgradtask/task5/RadGrad5.gif?raw=true'} size='big' centered/>\n          <div className='comment'>The sample rundown of the Task 5 interest description function.</div>\n          <b><u>Task 6 - Editing Description</u></b><br/>\n          For this task, we were asked to create something similar to Task 5 but the difference is that it also has the ability to \"Edit the Description\". To start on this task, I took a look at my previous code that I created in the past to rekindle my memory on how to do so.\n          After that, I took a look at the RadGrad GitHub to see what is \"RadGrad's Rule of Thumb\" on setting up similar code. Following the hints listed by Professor Johnson,\n          I created two components that stored two different components: one with the interest dropdown and one with the interest description update function.\n          <br/>\n          The first component was not as hard to do as it was similar to Task 5. The challenging part of this task was creating the description updates for me.\n          After reviewing some code and taking in between breaks, I was able to display the forms necessary for the updates.\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/radgradtask/task6/task6.png?raw=true'} size='big' centered/>\n          <div className='comment'><span className=\"bold-list\">How Task 6 displays when I login as myself.</span></div>\n          <br/>\n          <b><u>Task 7- Creating Tabs and Modals</u></b><br/>\n          The final task was not as hard compared to Task 6. To begin this task I began by making a general structure of the tabs.\n          Then after consulting with Professor Moore over Discord, I decided to add top 3 favorites of the previous tasks to place in the tabs.\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/radgradtask/task7/task7bar.png?raw=true'} size='big' centered/>\n          <div className='comment'><span className=\"bold-list\">The three tabs are from Task 2, 3, and 5.</span></div>\n          Since Task 5, the description of the interests was a big size compared to other two, I chose this task to be the modal.\n          I created the three tabs as a list and then used the Tab from Semantic UI React and created three tab headers using the <span className=\"bold-list\"><code>RadGradTabHeader</code></span>.\n          The tab making was the easiest but I personally struggled with making the modals because I did not have prior experience in either 314 or 414.\n          My initial thought was that it was going to be similar to \"pop-ups\", but after taking to Professor Moore I found it was a little different. Therefore, I took a look at the codes\n          he <a href=\"https://github.com/radgrad/radgrad2/blob/adef8036b09a0c6e0f998fd91856c1cea081a512/app/imports/ui/components/shared/manage/career-goal/EditCareerGoalButton.tsx\">recommended</a>.\n          After looking at it I followed the steps and created the modal for Task 5's tab where the user would click the button and then the modal would appear.\n          <Image src='https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/radgradtask/task7/RadGradTask7.gif?raw=true' size='big' centered/>\n          <div className='comment'><span className=\"bold-list\">A sample visual of how the Tabs and Modals work.</span></div>\n        </Container>\n        <div className =\"push\"/>\n      </Container>\n);\n}\n\nexport default RadGradStart;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Header, Container, Grid } from 'semantic-ui-react';\n\nfunction Math() {\n  return (\n      <Container>\n        <br/>\n        <Header as =\"h2\" textAlign=\"center\">Hawaii Math State Challenge</Header>\n       <Grid textAlign='center'><span className='bold-list'>2020-02-15</span> </Grid>\n        <Grid textAlign='center'>Mathematics, Education, Event</Grid>\n        <br/>\n        <Container text>\n          <hr/>\n          <p> The project the Hawaii State Challenge is an event organized by the Department of Education to teach elemntary school students to high school kids about the applications of math in the local neighborhood. The main topic that was used for this project was how math can be applied to revive the nature of the island of Kahoolawe. The project was broken into parts: the research, educational planner, and the educational facilitator. The part I took was the planner and the facilitator. Since people from different age groups learn math differently, as a planner and facilitator, we devised plans on what is appropriate and fun to make the learning enaging.\n            <br/>\n            The event was held on Feburary 15, 2020 at Kapiolani Community College and the main age group for that event was high school students. Unlike, elementary school students, not many props were neccessary since majority are young adults, the learning process idea was still difficult to create. My group decided to do an engaging presentation while presenting we would do questionares and asking opinions. My job was to design the presentation based off of what my teammates desired and created it to be engaging and not boring at all.\n            <br/>\n            What I have learned so far is that creating a presentation that is fun but still keeping the professionalism is difficult. Sometimes fun tends to make things more unprofessional and as a result it decreases our credibility. Additionally, trying to organize others thought was another challenge as there were times where I misinterpreted ones thought based off of a note.

The sudden pass of basketball superstar Mr. Kobe Bryant or democratic\n            presidential candidate Mr. Joe Biden making a comeback against the other presidential candidate Mr. Bernie Sanders. However, the biggest impact was something that is not visible to the human eye. It started in China and because\n            of the World Health Organization, WHO for short, not being prompt with it affected the many countries across the globe. I am talking about COVID-19 or Corona Virus which is a more popular term. The disease that started in China\n            has affected my undergraduate life in terms of courses, work, and personal life.\n            <br />\n            <b>Online Class Transition</b><br />\n            One of the biggest transitions due to the COVID-19 is many things are going virtual. To begin with, many of the courses have gone online such as using video conference applications like Zoom or BlueJeans to replace lectures.\n            Some professors have recorded themselves lecturing and replaced regular lecture time with additional office hours through Zoom or Piazza.\n            <br />\n            In my opinion, studying for online courses do not differ from regular on-campus courses because they have the same amount of workload. For example, ICS 314 is not that different online because most of the assignments are on the\n            class website and that we just had to follow the schedule online. If there were any differences to point out, that would be we as the students do not get to hear Professor Johnson’s energetic mood which helps when you are taking\n            a class with him at 9 AM.\n            <br />\n            Despite the COVID-19 leaving a negative impact, there are some benefits to classes going online. To begin with, I can learn at my own pace and timing. Many of the professors have not only extended due dates for some assignments,\n            but they have also uploaded them early on their homepages. Thus, I can start on the assignments earlier and turn it in. Additionally, since the majority of the professors understand that we have to be isolated, they have not\n            been assigning group work.\n            <br />\n            However, due to social isolation, there is a feeling that life has become dull. As mentioned previously, I like to be proactive with my work. In other words, I like to get it over as soon and efficiently as possible. Since the\n            professors list all of the work for the week on either Monday or Tuesday, I finish them by Wednesday. After finishing them, there is a feeling of emptiness as there is nothing else to do. True, there are some classwork and\n            projects that are due daily or at the end of the semester. Additionally, the feeling of emptiness increases when you cannot go to the classroom and talk to classmates about classwork.\n            <br />\n            Furthermore, because of self-quarantine, many of the exams that were scheduled post-spring break (any dates after April 23) have turned into a take-home exam. While some people may think a take-home exam is beneficial because no\n            professor or teaching assistant is supervising. I think take-home exams are a pain because they are written to be harder than an in-class exam because we have the resources. For example, I am taking an upper divisional math\n            analysis course. To explain it, the course is similar to Calculus 1 and 2, but proof heavy. The take-home exam was our second exam and it was more difficult than the first exam. It was not difficult because of the topics.\n            Rather, it was difficult because unlike in-class exams, minor mistakes are not forgiven easily on a take-home exam. And having a personal anxiety problem and knowing that the exam is harder does not help.\n            <br />\n            <b> Work Field Online Transition </b>\n            <br />\n            Similar to the online transition of classes, the majority of my work has transitioned to online. On-campus, I work as a grader, learning assistant which is similar to an assistant teaching assistant in the lower divisional ICS\n            courses, and as a tutor for the math department. Outside of campus, I work as an English to Japanese and vice versa translator and as an amateur designer. The off-campus were not affected heavily from the virus as they were\n            online jobs, to begin with. If there was any difference to point out, the email conversation with my supervisors has increased.\n            <br />\n            As a Learning Assistant, LA for short, my job is to help out students with Calculus 2 from the perspective of an undergraduate student. Besides me, there are 5 other LA’s in the Calculus 2 team and what we did is practically\n            similar to most math courses offered in the university. I also do Zoom office hours with my students to help with their homework or study for exams.\n            <br />\n            However, similar to online class transitions, there are many downsides I notice. For example, I noticed how my supervisors do not deserve the title of being supervisors. As mentioned previously, for one of my jobs I work as a\n            tutor at the Learning Emporium, emporium for short. My coworker and I were the ones who set up the online environment despite the supervisor having a team for it. This bugged me because according to the job description written\n            on the university’s job website Sece my job was to tutor and they were the ones to set up the online environment.\n            <br />\n            Additionally, my coworker and I were able to have students sign up to the emporium with no trouble, but whenever the supervisor and her team help out there is trouble. Usually, the trouble comes from the supervisor and her team\n            being unable to use basic tools on a computer. This is sad as her team and I are no different in age and not being able to use technology in the 21st century will take you nowhere in life as it has become a necessity in modern\n            life.\n            <br />\n            While it is true that the situation we are going through is strange, that is no excuse to not act professionally. There are times when I email people and notice the cultural difference, but this is beyond the line. Our\n            supervisor has blamed my coworker and me for all the mess caused by her team and has emailed us in a bratty way even though we are professionally emailing her. The behavior that our supervisor has displayed from a third party\n            perspective would be considered rude, racist, immature, and more importantly unprofessional.\n            <br />\n            <b> Community affected due to COVID-19 </b>\n            <br />\n            Further to add, the virus also affected my social life. Unlike most people, I do not have many friends or family members that I am close with, but while I hate to admit it, I have an addiction to tapioca milk tea drinks.\n            However, because of the virus pandemic, many stores that I usually go to on the weekends such as “Coffee or Tea” or “Cha Tea” have closed its store temporarily. While there are still delivery services, I miss the joy of walking\n            to those stores and doing homework at the cafes. I also like to eat and not being able to have sushi or poke because of the fear of getting the virus tears me apart.\n            <br />\n            Additionally, because of Governor David Ige’s order, gyms and parks were forced to close down. This is sad for me because that reduces my reasons to go outside and take a break from work. Do not get me wrong, I understand the\n            need behind self lockdown, but there is also part of me that feels staying cooped inside forever is poison to the body. That is why I decided to create a schedule where I do the dance exercises found on YouTube and also replaced\n            my desk chair with a yoga ball.\n            <br />\n            Previously, I mentioned that classwork gets done quickly because of online courses. With that, I have gained more free time because there is no need to dedicate time for transportation. I have been able to draw and do some\n            coloring more, constructed some models that I was not able to before, and started studying for classes that I plan to take next semester since I fear courses are going to be online too next semester.\n            <br />\n            We have just finished 25 percent of the year 2020 and it has taken the biggest hit compared to what I have seen in the last 21 years of my life. This pandemic has required me to be alone which is a good thing because there are\n            many things I notice. For instance, having a horrible supervisor gives me the practice of what not to become when I take a leadership position. The emphasis on staying clean is found too. But, I feel like we are far from over\n            with this global pandemic. I feel like the worst that has to come from this has yet to come.\n            <br />\n          </p>\n        </Container>\n        <div className=\"push\" />\n      </Container>\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Covid;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Header, Container, Grid, Image, Button } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport '../style.css';\nimport { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction RadGradPilotStudy() {\n  return (\n      <Container>\n        <br/>\n        <Header as = 'h2' textAlign=\"center\">Rising With RadGrad <br/>A Quantitative Study on Leveling Up Student Retention and Degree Success</Header>\n        <Grid textAlign = \"center\">\n          <p>RadGrad2, Summer 2021 Internship Program, Software Engineering <br/>\n          </p>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid textAlign=\"center\">\n          <p><span className=\"bold-list\">July 30, 2021</span></p>\n        </Grid>\n        <br/>\n        <Container text>\n         <b>Abstract</b><br/>\n          In the last few decades, there has been a steady decline in the diversity of students graduating with a Computer Science degree. The RadGrad project tackles this issue by providing an alternative perspective to the undergraduate degree program. The approach in RadGrad is to make extracurricular activities equal in importance to curricular activities when designing a “well-balanced” degree plan. To accomplish this, RadGrad presents an alternative to GPA with Innovation, Competency, Experience points also known as MyI.C.E. In addition, RadGrad is designed to provide a “knowledge base” about the discipline including topic areas (called “Interests”) and Career Goals, Courses, Opportunities, (and in the near future), Internships. The goal for this summer is to make RadGrad v2.0 ready for deployment into both the ICS Department and the Computer Engineering program starting in Fall 2021. This summer, we participated in the development and evaluation of the second major version of RadGrad. So far, we improved the functionality of the system, and made progress on the integration of InternAloha, a plugin designed to help students find internships. In addition, we conducted a pilot study to investigate ways to improve the system based on real-life student perspectives. The results of the pilot study will be used to improve the design of the system, and include such findings as: user experience issues and the lack of incentive of some features. Through this experience we learned various skills and techniques used to develop a moderately-sized application and conduct meaningful software evaluations while focusing on larger research issues surrounding diversity in Computer Science.\n          <Grid.Column textAlign=\"center\">\n            <a href = \"https://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2021/21-01/21-01.pdf\"><Button>READ ESSAY</Button></a>\n          </Grid.Column>\n        </Container>\n        <div className=\"push\"/>\n      </Container>\n\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default RadGradPilotStudy;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Header, Container, Grid, Image } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction Internaloha() {\n  return (\n      <Container>\n        <br/>\n        <Header as =\"h2\" textAlign=\"center\">Internaloha 2.0</Header>\n        <Grid textAlign = \"center\">\n          <p textAlign=\"center\"> <b> Software Engineering, TypeScript, Scrapers </b> <br/></p>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid textAlign=\"center\">\n          <p><span className=\"bold-list\"> 2021-12-10</span> </p>\n        </Grid>\n        <br/>\n        <Container text>\n          <hr/>\n          For my Capstone Project course (<a href =\"https://manoa.hawaii.edu/catalog/courses/ics-496-capstone-project-3/\">ICS 469</a>) I have teamed up with Professor Johnson with the development of Internaloha Scrappers.\n          <ul>\n            <li>Group Organization: <a href = \"https://internaloha.github.io/documentation/\">LINK</a></li>\n            <li>GitHub Repository: <a href =\"https://github.com/internaloha/scrapers\">LINK</a></li>\n          </ul>\n          <b><u>Overview of Internaloha</u></b><br/>\n          Initially, University of Hawaii Computer Science undergraduates were able to find internships through the previous version internship page of RadGrad. However, since this version needed each internship to be manually entered. In order to spread internship awareness efficiently, Internaloha was created.\n          Internaloha is an automated scraper system of collecting internships from a variety of job searching websites and having them displayed on the RadGrad internship explorer page. Version 1 uses Javascript and the tool Puppeteer. A node.js library which uses Chromium dev tool, Puppeteer runs headless on default. Each scraper goes to a page and then manually searches through the site for internships. Eventually data is stored inside a JSON file. Finally, the data on the JSON file is manually transferred to RadGrad’s internship explorer page.\n          <Image src={\"https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/internaloha/radgrad.png?raw=true\"} size='large' centered/>\n          <div className=\"comment\"> A sample internship explorer on the RadGrad application.</div>\n          <br/>\n          <b><u>Purpose</u></b><br/>\n          The main purpose of this project was to update the previous scrappers by using TypeScript and a common format. Previously, the scrappers were written by a different group of students where the basic format was not necessarily uniform.\n          For the Fall 2021, our main goal was to update is using classes and making it more unified within the different scrappers. <br/>\n          Using the <a href =\"https://github.com/internaloha/scrapers/projects/1\">Project Board</a> function from GitHub, each student worked on a certain issue regarding to the scrappers.\n          <br/>\n          <b><u>Contribution to Internaloha Version 2</u></b>\n          <br />\n          Below are the different scrappers and a brief summary associated to it. <br />\n          <b><a href=\"https://github.com/internaloha/scrapers/blob/main/scrapers/Scraper.ziprecruiter.ts\">ZipRecruiter Scrapper</a></b><br />\n          ZipRecruiter, was the first scraper I wrote with the new format. Initially, my process was to translate the code written in version 1 of the same ZipRecruiter and then run it. However, after the first trial I noticed that that was\n          not an option.\n          To begin with, the HTML code that was written in version 1 did not match the current ZipRecruiter set up. Furthermore, there was a for loop within the code that did not make any sense as iterated within the same item five times.\n          <br />\n          Compared to the other scrapers, writing ZipRecruiter took a longer time to write. Furthermore, the difficulty here was having the scraper keep scrolling through the page until there are no available jobs. With the new format,\n          ZipRecruiter was written using 48 lines of code where version 1 of the same website required 130 lines of code.\n          <br />\n          <Image className=\"ui centered big image\" src=\"https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/internaloha/zipcomp.png?raw=true\"/>\n            <div className=\"comment\">\n              A screenshot of the code of Version 1 (on left) and Version 2 (on right) of Zip Recruiter Scraper.\n            </div>\n            Overall, working on ZipRecruiter scraper provided a basic understanding on creating scrapers on the new format.\n            <br/>\n          <b><a href = \"https://github.com/internaloha/scrapers/blob/main/scrapers/Scraper.monster.ts\">Monster Scrapper</a></b><br/>\n          For the second scraper, I wrote a scraper for Monster. The challenging part of Monster was to have it iterate it through multiple pages through a tab. Monster was similar to ZipRecruiter where the as long as there are information, the page can keep scrolling down through the list of internships. Unlike ZipRecruiter or other job websites, there was no div section name to create a while loop for. However, when looking at the source code using Google Chrome, there existed a div button where it stored the next section of listings. Thus, the scraper will keep extracting URL as long as the button exists.\n          <br/>\n          Furthermore, the Monster page is set up where all of the necessary information is spread out. Thus, the scraper collects the URL, position title, and company name from the main page. Then, the scraper goes to the individual URL of that specific position title and extracts the description of the job and the job location. While the job location was written in the main page, it was simpler to extract it from the individual position page for an easier to readable code.\n          <br/>\n          <b><a href=\"https://github.com/internaloha/scrapers/blob/main/scrapers/Scraper.glassdoor.ts\">GlassDoor Scrapper</a></b><br/>\n          This was the third scrapper I have worked on. <br/>\n          In the original scrapper GlassDoor took one to two hours to scrape all the necessary information. After writing two scrappers writing the scrapers itself did not\n          take a long time compared to the previous two. However, unlike the two scrapers, the scraper only took the url from the main page and rest of the necessary information (position title, company, description, etc.)\n          was scrapped from going to that certain URL. <br/>\n          Furthermore, since the GlassDoor scrapper has multiple pages depending on the week, I created a for loop by scrapping the number of pages.\n          <br/>\n          <br/>\n          <b><a href =\"https://github.com/internaloha/scrapers/blob/403de67709b04523503e6cb516c8555ef3dbdb73/scrapers/Scraper.stackoverflow.ts\">StackOverFlow Scrapper</a></b><br/>\n          This was the fourth scrapper I have worked on. <br/>\n          Initially, the pattern was similar to others so writing it initially was not bad. However, after doing a test scrape I noticed that the total jobs scrapped were greater than the amount of internships available.\n          I noticed that the scrapper scraped the recommended jobs. Therefore, to avoid this I extracted the number of internships listed on the page and then did the for loop based on that instead of the urls.length.\n          <br/>\n          <b><u>Essay and Video</u></b><br/>\n        As a requirement for ICS 496, the last week was spent on creating a poster, a report, and a video presentation of Internaloha. While the video and poster was created as a team, the paper itself was done individually.\n        The essay was written using LaTex and is uploaded <a href =\"https://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2021/21-02/21-02.pdf\">here</a>.<br/>\n          <Image className=\"ui centered big image\" src=\"https://www.radgrad.org/img/fall-2021/internaloha-fall-2021.png\"/>\n          <br />\n          <div className=\"comment\">\n            The presentation created describing the process of revamping Internaloha.\n            <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U2Rmrr2908M\"></iframe>\n            <br />\n            The video describing what was done to revamp Internaloha.\n          </div>\n          <b><u>Results from Participation</u></b><br/>\n          Working on Internaloha gave me an eye-opener to scrapers and the legal aspect of software engineering. However, I think the most important thing I gained from participating is how code should be written. One of the personal issues I had with version 1 is that majority of the scraper code was hard to comprehend and digest. While it is true that they still scraped the different websites, this might lead to an issue in the future when the website is updated or changes its format. This was the case for ZipRecruiter. Thus, it motivated me to check the code twice for any improvements or add comments to any code that might look weird.<br/>\n          Furthermore, while the online setting was not a challenge as this is my third semester doing a group project online, it did allow me to reflect on how to work more effectively.\n          For example, since most of the discussions were held through Discord, I made it a habit to add an emoji reply on the message to notify that I have read the message. Overall, I think participating in this group allowed me to continue the skills I have gained from RadGrad2 but a different angle.\n        </Container>\n        <div className =\"push\"/>\n      </Container>\n\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Internaloha;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { HashRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport {\n  Navigation,\n  Home,\n  About,\n  Resume,\n  Project,\n  Essay,\n  JPN,\n  RadGrad,\n  Shocking,\n  TextbookHunt,\n  RadGradReview,\n  RadGradFeedback,\n  RadGradStart,\n  Math,\n  Uhmath,\n  Tregear,\n  Tokusatsu,\n  CrossCountry,\n  Covid,\n  RadGradPilotStudy,\n  Internaloha\n} from \"./components\";\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n      <div className=\"App\">\n        <Router>\n          <Navigation />\n          <Switch>\n            <Route path=\"/\" exact component={() => <Home />} />\n            <Route path=\"/about\" exact component={() => <About />} />\n            <Route path=\"/jpn\" exact component={() => <JPN />} />\n            <Route path=\"/resume\" exact component={() => <Resume />} />\n            <Route path=\"/project\" exact component={() => <Project />} />\n            <Route path=\"/essay\" exact component={() => <Essay />} />\n            <Route path=\"/radgrad\" exact component={() => <RadGrad />} />\n            <Route path=\"/math\" exact component={() => <Math />} />\n            <Route path=\"/uhmath\" exact component={() => <Uhmath />} />\n            <Route path=\"/shocking\" exact component={() => <Shocking />} />\n            <Route path=\"/radgradreview\" exact component={() => <RadGradReview />} />\n            <Route path=\"/radgradfeedback\" exact component={() => <RadGradFeedback />} />\n            <Route path=\"/radgradstart\" exact component={() => <RadGradStart />} />\n            <Route path=\"/textbookhunt\" exact component={() => <TextbookHunt />} />\n            <Route path=\"/crosscountry\" exact component={() => <CrossCountry />} />\n            <Route path=\"/tregear\" exact component={() => <Tregear />} />\n            <Route path=\"/tokusatsu\" exact component={() => <Tokusatsu />} />\n            <Route path=\"/covid\" exact component={() => <Covid />} />\n            <Route path=\"/pilotstudy-radgrad\" exact component={() => <RadGradPilotStudy />} />\n            <Route path=\"/internaloha\" exact component={() => <Internaloha/>}/>\n          </Switch>\n        </Router>\n      </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
