To explain it, the course is similar to Calculus 1 and 2, but proof heavy. The take-home exam was our second exam and it was more difficult than the first exam.

The goal for this summer is to make RadGrad v2.0 ready for deployment into both the ICS Department and the Computer Engineering program starting in Fall 2021. This summer, we participated in the development and evaluation of the second major version of RadGrad.
