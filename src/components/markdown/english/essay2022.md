As I get older I feel like the speed of each year gets faster and faster. When I thought 2021 just started, it is almost coming to an end with 2022 starting. With the coming of the New Years, I thought it would be good to reflect on the year. <br/>

### Pros of 2021 
Despite the start of 2021 being similar to 2020 with COVID-19 and stay home orders I genuinely felt that there were some beneficial moments. To begin with was the diverse amount of jobs both internships and part time jobs I took part in. 
<ol>
<li> <b>Learning Assistant</b> <br/> For those who are unfamiliar, a Learning Assistant is basically a Teaching Assistant expect an undergraduate student version of it. 
This year I increased my work load and participated in helping out with 300 level courses. This was feeling of fresh air to say the least as it provided me with the opportunity to help students who are Juniors and above. Most of these Juniors were able to ask smart questions as in more than "I do not know what I do not know" type of questions. <br/> </li>
<li><b>ICS 414 Shocking Emissions </b><br/>
Under Professor Moore, I took ICS 414 - Software Engineering II. This course teamed up with the Hawaiian Electric and over the semester an application to measure the customer's green house gases usage. <br/>
This was an interesting task because it was the first time I worked on a single project over the course of the semester. With the course being online, it gave me a preview on what it is like to work online such as doing team meetings with Discord and Zoom.</li>
<li><b>RadGrad Software Engineering Intern</b> <br/></li>
<li><b>Internaloha Research Assistant</b></li>
</ol>
<h3>Cons of 2021</h3>
With pros there are some downsides. For the sake of common sense, I will place COVID-19 and Stay Home Order aside as a con. The reason being it is already been an year, so as a human being we should be able to adapt to changes.
