As I get older I feel like the speed of each year gets faster and faster. When I thought 2021 just started, it is almost coming to an end with 2022 starting. With the coming of the New Years, I thought it would be good to reflect on the year. <br/>

### Pros of 2021 
Despite the start of 2021 being similar to 2020 with COVID-19 and stay home orders I genuinely felt that there were some beneficial moments. To begin with was the diverse amount of jobs both internships and part time jobs I took part in. 
<ol>
<li> <b>Learning Assistant</b> <br/> For those who are unfamiliar, a Learning Assistant is basically a Teaching Assistant expect an undergraduate student version of it. 
This year I increased my work load and participated in helping out with 300 level courses. This was feeling of fresh air to say the least as it provided me with the opportunity to help students who are Juniors and above. Most of these Juniors were able to ask smart questions as in more than "I do not know what I do not know" type of questions. <br/> </li>
<li><b>ICS 414 Shocking Emissions </b><br/>
Under Professor Moore, I took ICS 414 - Software Engineering II. This course teamed up with the Hawaiian Electric and over the semester an application to measure the customer's green house gases usage. <br/>
This was an interesting task because it was the first time I worked on a single project over the course of the semester. With the course being online, it gave me a preview on what it is like to work online such as doing team meetings with Discord and Zoom.</li>

</ol>
<h3>Cons of 2021</h3>
With pros there are some downsides. For the sake of common sense, I will place COVID-19 and Stay Home Order aside as a con. The reason being it is already been an year, so as a human being we should be able to adapt to changes. 
<ol>
<li><b>Prioritizing luxury over work and discipline.</b><br/>This September I was invited to a small event by an acquaintance of mine. Suprisingly, I accepted the offer and went. However, that was something I regret. In a short run the event was interesting but in the long run I could have spent that time studying for quizzes for classes or working on self projects. 
</li>
<li><b>Having a positive mindset.</b><br/>We live in an era of extreme Political Correctness and as a result it has brought some toxic positivity. I was recommeded by certain people to have a positive mindset. However, having this positive mindset resulted in lower test scores and poor work results. This then eventually made me thinking why am I listening to people with poor credibility.</li>

### Goals for 2022 
Based on the pros and cons, below are some of the resolutions for 2022.
<ol>
<li><b>Prioritizing studying, hobbies, and working over everything else. </b>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">社会人が1日にする平均勉強時間は6分。これはもし10人中1人が1時間勉強していれば残りの9人は全く勉強はしていないということです。<a href="https://t.co/52OgdYOeKp">pic.twitter.com/52OgdYOeKp</a></p>
According to this tweet, the average person only spends 6 minutes learning or studying. This is understandable as there is only 24 hours a day. Thus, to increase it I plan to prioritize the three. <br/>
In a situation of being invited to a party or a drinking event, I plan to decline it and prioritize the three. 
</li>
<li><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b><br/>I think one of the joys that most young adults have is drinking alcohol at events or to boost themselves from depression. According to this <a href = "https://financialpost.com/personal-finance/young-money/how-much-money-we-waste-on-booze">article</a>, young people can save many money from not drinking. <br/> Furthermore, from looking at my peer's social media I have noticed the amount of time that is wasted at drinking with friends. Time that can be spent on learning a <b>new programming language</b> or <b>exercising self-image</b>.
</li>
<li><b>Oversleeping is a Sin.</b><br/> While the amount of sleep differs from person to person, if a person sleeps for 6 hours then they have already used 25% of the day sleeping. It is undeniable that sleeping is important, however, to use most of each day wisely, I plan to cut down onto sleep and place a max of 5 to 6 hours each day.  </li>
